# Introduction

Deep learning is an important machine learning technique that helps computers identify objects in images. Medical images are used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases, injuries, and congenital abnormalities.

Deep learning can be used to detect diseases like cancer by finding tumor cells through medical images. Deep learning also has the potential to improve the quality of medical care by segmenting organs during surgery or scanning patients for signs of cancer or other ailments.

The goal of this repository is to create a deep learning model to segment a liver from a public CT scan dataset. After completing this series, you will be able to create the same model that segments the liver, as well as use the same principle to segment other organs or tumors from CT scans or MRIs.

# Datasets

[Decathlon dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ--2), choosing Task 3, the liver

I personnaly tried the decathlon dataset it is recommended by the pytorch team but kaggle datasets are pretty interesting too.
